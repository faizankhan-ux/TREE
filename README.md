# Binary Tree â€“ Hierarchical Data Structure  

A **binary tree** is a tree where each parent node has at most **two** child nodes.  

### Key Terms  
- **Root**: The head (topmost node) of the binary tree.  
- **Leaf**: A node with no child nodes.  
- **Subtree**: A portion of the tree that itself forms a tree.  

## Types of Binary Trees  

1. **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has either **0** or **2** children.

2. **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are completely filled **except the last**, where nodes are as far left as possible.

3. **Perfect Binary Tree**: All leaf nodes are at the **same level**.

4. **Balanced Binary Tree**: The tree height is at most **log(N)**.

5. **Degenerate (Skewed) Binary Tree**: Each node has **only one child**.
